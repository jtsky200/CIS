# Cadillac EV App - Fixes Applied

## Date: October 24, 2025
## Version: After Fix Session

---

## FIXES COMPLETED

### ✅ Fix #1: Corrected External Script Reference (Issue #10)
**File:** `public/troubleshooting.html`  
**Problem:** Reference to `../integrate-advanced-troubleshooting.js` was incorrect (file is in root, not accessible from public folder)  
**Solution:** Commented out the invalid script reference and added explanatory comment  
**Impact:** Removes console errors, improves page load  

**Changes:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<script src="../integrate-advanced-troubleshooting.js"></script>

<!-- After -->
<!-- <script src="../integrate-advanced-troubleshooting.js"></script> -->
<!-- File not accessible from public folder - functionality integrated in app.js -->
```

---

### ✅ Fix #2: Removed Debug Logging Code (Issue #7)
**File:** `public/settings.html`  
**Problem:** Debug console logging code present in production (45 lines of debug code)  
**Solution:** Removed all debug logging functions and event listeners  
**Impact:** Cleaner console, slightly better performance, reduced JavaScript execution  

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: 45 lines of debug code
function debugButtons() { ... }
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', debugButtons);
// etc.

// After: Simple comment
// Debug code removed for production
```
