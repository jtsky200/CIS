# Cursor Rules for Cadillac EV App Development

## CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULE
**NEVER deploy changes without explicit user confirmation!**

### Deployment Process:
1. Make code changes
2. Show changes to user
3. **WAIT for user to confirm with words like "confirmed", "deploy", "yes", "go ahead", or similar**
4. Only THEN run `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### Important:
- DO NOT assume user wants to deploy
- DO NOT deploy automatically after making changes
- DO NOT deploy just because changes look good
- ALWAYS wait for explicit confirmation
- User will say "confirmed", "deploy it", "yes deploy", or similar phrases when ready

## Other Development Guidelines
- Always use professional, consistent design
- Keep button sizes normal and proportional
- Maintain font weights for readability
- Ensure dark/light theme works across all pages
- Test functionality before showing to user
- Keep code clean and well-commented
