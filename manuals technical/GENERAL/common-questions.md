# Cadillac LYRIQ Frequently Asked Questions

## Charging and Range

### Q: How do I start preconditioning?
**A:** Use the myCadillac mobile app:
1. Open the app and select your LYRIQ
2. Tap "Remote Start" or "Climate" 
3. Set your desired temperature
4. Press "Start Preconditioning"
5. The vehicle will begin heating/cooling the cabin

### Q: Why is my charging slow?
**A:** Several factors affect charging speed:
- **Temperature:** Cold weather reduces charging speed
- **Charger type:** Level 1 (120V) charges slowest, DC fast charging is fastest
- **Battery temperature:** Hot batteries charge slower to protect longevity
- **State of charge:** Charging slows down as battery approaches 100%
- **Power sharing:** Multiple vehicles on same circuit reduces speed

### Q: How can I maximize my range?
**A:** Follow these range optimization tips:
- Use Eco driving mode
- Maintain proper tire pressure (check monthly)
- Precondition while plugged in
- Use seat heaters instead of cabin heat when possible
- Remove excess weight from vehicle
- Plan routes to avoid extreme weather when possible

### Q: What's the difference between AC and DC charging?
**A:** 
- **AC Charging:** Slower, used at home and work (Level 1: 3-5 mph, Level 2: 25-30 mph)
- **DC Fast Charging:** Much faster, used for road trips (up to 76 mph with 190kW charger)
- **Cost:** AC charging is typically less expensive than DC fast charging

## Climate and Comfort

### Q: How does preconditioning work?
**A:** Preconditioning benefits:
- **When plugged in:** Uses grid power, preserves battery range
- **When unplugged:** Uses battery power, reduces available range
- **Timing:** Can be scheduled via app for regular departure times
- **Temperature:** Heats or cools cabin to set temperature before entry

### Q: Why is my range lower in cold weather?
**A:** Cold weather impact:
- Battery chemistry is less efficient in cold
- Cabin heating uses significant energy
- Tire pressure drops, increasing rolling resistance
- Use preconditioning and seat heaters to minimize impact

### Q: How do I adjust the driver profiles?
**A:** Setting up driver profiles:
